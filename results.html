              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/richardgirges/express-fileupload">express-fileupload</a> is a file upload middleware for express that wraps around busboy.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).
          The package does not limit file name length.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.</p>
          <p>Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.</p>
          <p>One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.</p>
          <p>When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.</p>
          <p>Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, <a href="SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082">commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  <a href="npm:ws:20171108">npm <code>ws</code> package</a></p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>
          <p>Upgrade <code>express-fileupload</code> to version 1.1.6-alpha.6 or higher.</p>

          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
          Templates may alter an Objects&#39; prototype, thus allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>_proto_</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>
          <p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Property definition by path</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="unsafe-object-recursive-merge">Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>
          <p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>
          <pre><code>merge (target, source)
          
            foreach property of source
          
              if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source
          
                merge(target[property], source[property])
          
              else
          
                target[property] = source[property]</code></pre><br>  
          
          <p>When the source object contains a property named <code>_proto_</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>
          <p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>
          <p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>
          <h3 id="property-definition-by-path">Property definition by path</h3>
          <p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>
          <p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>_proto_.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars">handlebars</a> is a extension to the Mustache templating language.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
          Templates may alter an Object&#39;s <code>__proto__</code> and <code>__defineGetter__</code> properties, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server through crafted payloads.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>_proto_</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>
          <p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Property definition by path</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="unsafe-object-recursive-merge">Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>
          <p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>
          <pre><code>merge (target, source)
          
            foreach property of source
          
              if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source
          
                merge(target[property], source[property])
          
              else
          
                target[property] = source[property]</code></pre><br>  
          
          <p>When the source object contains a property named <code>_proto_</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>
          <p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>
          <p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>
          <h3 id="property-definition-by-path">Property definition by path</h3>
          <p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>
          <p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>_proto_.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>
          <h2 id="types-of-attacks">Types of attacks</h2>
          <p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Origin</th>
          <th>Short description</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br><strong>For example:</strong> <code>eval(someobject.someattr)</code>. In this case, if the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <h2 id="affected-environments">Affected environments</h2>
          <p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Application server</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Web server</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="how-to-prevent">How to prevent</h2>
          <ol>
          <li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p>
          </li>
          </ol>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars">handlebars</a> is an extension to the Mustache templating language.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
          It is possible to add or modify properties to the Object prototype through a malicious template. This may allow attackers to crash the application or execute Arbitrary Code in specific conditions.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>_proto_</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>
          <p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Property definition by path</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="unsafe-object-recursive-merge">Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>
          <p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>
          <pre><code>merge (target, source)
          
            foreach property of source
          
              if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source
          
                merge(target[property], source[property])
          
              else
          
                target[property] = source[property]</code></pre><br>  
          
          <p>When the source object contains a property named <code>_proto_</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>
          <p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>
          <p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>
          <h3 id="property-definition-by-path">Property definition by path</h3>
          <p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>
          <p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>_proto_.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>
          <h2 id="types-of-attacks">Types of attacks</h2>
          <p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery">jquery</a> is a JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
          attacks when a cross-domain ajax request is performed without the <code>dataType</code> option causing <code>text/javascript</code> responses to be executed.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p> A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>
          <p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>
          <p>ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>
          <p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>
          <p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. </p>
          <h3 id="types-of-attacks">Types of attacks</h3>
          <p>There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Origin</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td><strong>Stored</strong></td>
          <td>Server</td>
          <td>The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td><strong>Reflected</strong></td>
          <td>Server</td>
          <td>The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td><strong>DOM-based</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td><strong>Mutated</strong></td>
          <td></td>
          <td>The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <h3 id="affected-environments">Affected environments</h3>
          <p>The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Web servers</li>
          <li>Application servers</li>
          <li>Web application environments</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="how-to-prevent">How to prevent</h3>
          <p>This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. </li>
          <li>Convert special characters such as <code>?</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. </li>
          <li>Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.</li>
          <li>Redirect invalid requests.</li>
          <li>Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.</li>
          <li>Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.</li>
          <li>Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.</li>
          </ul>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml">js-yaml</a> is a human-friendly data serialization language.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).
          The parsing of a specially crafted YAML file may exhaust the system resources.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.</p>
          <p>Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.</p>
          <p>One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.</p>
          <p>When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.</p>
          <p>Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, <a href="SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082">commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  <a href="npm:ws:20171108">npm <code>ws</code> package</a></p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>

          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>_proto_</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>
          <p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Property definition by path</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="unsafe-object-recursive-merge">Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>
          <p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>
          <pre><code>merge (target, source)
          
            foreach property of source
          
              if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source
          
                merge(target[property], source[property])
          
              else
          
                target[property] = source[property]</code></pre><br>  
          
          <p>When the source object contains a property named <code>_proto_</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>
          <p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>
          <p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>
          <h3 id="property-definition-by-path">Property definition by path</h3>
          <p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>
          <p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>_proto_.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>
          <h2 id="types-of-attacks">Types of attacks</h2>
          <p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Origin</th>
          <th>Short description</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br><strong>For example:</strong> <code>eval(someobject.someattr)</code>. In this case, if the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <h2 id="affected-environments">Affected environments</h2>
          <p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

          </li>
          <li><p>Web server</p>

          </ul>
          <h2 id="how-to-prevent">How to prevent</h2>
          <ol>
          <li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Property definition by path</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="unsafe-object-recursive-merge">Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>
          <p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>
          <pre><code>merge (target, source)
          
            foreach property of source
          
              if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source
          
                merge(target[property], source[property])
          
              else
          
                target[property] = source[property]</code></pre><br>  
          
          <p>When the source object contains a property named <code>_proto_</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>
          <p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>
          <p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>
          <h3 id="property-definition-by-path">Property definition by path</h3>
          <p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>
          <p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>_proto_.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>
          <h2 id="types-of-attacks">Types of attacks</h2>
          <p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash">lodash</a> is a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance, &amp; extras.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).
          It parses dates using regex strings, which may cause a slowdown of 2 seconds per 50k characters.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td>ACCCX</td>
          <td align="right">3</td>
          <td align="right">38</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">4</td>
          <td align="right">71</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">5</td>
          <td align="right">136</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">14</td>
          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

          <p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>_proto_</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>
          <p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Property definition by path</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="unsafe-object-recursive-merge">Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>
          <p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>
          <pre><code>merge (target, source)
          
            foreach property of source
          
              if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source
          
                merge(target[property], source[property])
          
              else
          
                target[property] = source[property]</code></pre><br>  
          
          <p>When the source object contains a property named <code>_proto_</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>
          <p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>
          <p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>
          <h3 id="property-definition-by-path">Property definition by path</h3>
          <p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>
          <p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>_proto_.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>
          <h2 id="types-of-attacks">Types of attacks</h2>
          <p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>

          <p><a href="https://marked.js.org/">marked</a> is a low-level compiler for parsing markdown without caching or blocking for long periods of time.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).
          The <code>inline.text regex</code> may take quadratic time to scan for potential email addresses starting at every point.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>

          <th>String</th>

          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td>ACCCX</td>

          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

          A  Denial of Service condition could be triggered through exploitation of the <code>heading</code> regex.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://marked.js.org/">marked</a> is a low-level compiler for parsing markdown without caching or blocking for long periods of time.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Content &amp; Code Injection (XSS).
          An attacker could bypass its output sanitization (<code>sanitize: true</code>) protection. Using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_13.html#SEC13">HTML Coded Character Set</a>, attackers can inject <code>javascript:</code> code snippets into the output. For example, the following input <code>javascript&amp;#x58document;alert&amp;#40;1&amp;#41;</code>  will result in <code>alert(1)</code> being executed when the user clicks on the link.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>
          <p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>
          <p>ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>
          <p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>
          <p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. </p>
          <h3 id="types-of-attacks">Types of attacks</h3>

          <p>This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. </li>
          <li>Convert special characters such as <code>?</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. </li>
          <li>Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.</li>
          <li>Redirect invalid requests.</li>
          <li>Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.</li>
          <li>Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.</li>
          <li>Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.</li>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://marked.js.org/">marked</a> is a low-level compiler for parsing markdown without caching or blocking for long periods of time.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
          Browsers support both lowercase and uppercase x in hexadecimal form of HTML character entity, but marked <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked/blob/v0.3.7/lib/marked.js#L1096-L1108">unescaped only lowercase</a>.</p>
          <p>This may allow an attacker to create a link with javascript code.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">var marked = require(&#39;marked&#39;);
          marked.setOptions({
            renderer: new marked.Renderer(),
            sanitize: true
          });
          
          text = `
          lower[click me](javascript&amp;#x3a;...)lower
          upper[click me](javascript&amp;#X3a;...)upper
          `;
          
          console.log(marked(text));</code></pre>
          <p>will render the following:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;lowerlower
          upper&lt;a href=&quot;javascript&amp;#X3a;...&quot;&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;upper&lt;/p&gt;
          </code></pre>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>
          <p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>
          <p>ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>
          <p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>
          <p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. </p>

          <p>This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. </li>
          <li>Convert special characters such as <code>?</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. </li>
          <li>Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.</li>
          <li>Redirect invalid requests.</li>
          <li>Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.</li>
          <li>Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.</li>
          <li>Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.</li>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked"><code>marked</code></a> is a full-featured markdown parser and compiler.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks when parsing the input markdown content (1,000 characters costs around 6 seconds matching time).</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>

          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb">mongodb</a> is a official MongoDB driver for Node.js.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).
          The package fails to properly catch an exception when a collection name is invalid and the DB does not exist, crashing the application.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.</p>
          <p>Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.</p>
          <p>One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.</p>
          <p>When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.</p>
          <p>Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, <a href="SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082">commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  <a href="npm:ws:20171108">npm <code>ws</code> package</a></p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>

          <p>A potential memory disclosure vulnerability exists in mongoose.
          A <code>Buffer</code> field in a MongoDB document can be used to expose sensitive
          information such as code, runtime memory and user data into MongoDB.</p>
          <h3 id="details">Details</h3>
          <p>Initializing a <code>Buffer</code> field in a document with integer <code>N</code> creates a <code>Buffer</code>
          of length <code>N</code> with non zero-ed out memory.
          <strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <pre><code>var x = new Buffer(100); // uninitialized Buffer of length 100
          // vs
          var x = new Buffer(&#39;100&#39;); // initialized Buffer with value of &#39;100&#39;</code></pre><p>Initializing a MongoDB document field in such manner will dump uninitialized
          memory into MongoDB.
          The patch wraps <code>Buffer</code> field initialization in mongoose by converting a
          <code>number</code> value <code>N</code> to array <code>[N]</code>, initializing the <code>Buffer</code> with <code>N</code> in its
          binary form.</p>
          <h4 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h4>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">var mongoose = require(&#39;mongoose&#39;);
          mongoose.connect(&#39;mongodb://localhost/bufftest&#39;);

          mongoose.model(&#39;Item&#39;, new mongoose.Schema({id: String, data: Buffer}));
          
          var Item = mongoose.model(&#39;Item&#39;);

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/adm-zip"><code>adm-zip</code></a> is a Javascript implementation of zip for NodeJS with support for electron original-fs. </p>
          <p>Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA &quot;Zip Slip&quot;).</p>
          <p>It can be exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a <code>../../file.exe</code> location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.</p>
          <p>The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in <code>/root/.ssh/</code> overwriting the <code>authorized_keys</code> file:</p>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/brace-expansion"><code>brace-expansion</code></a> is a package that performs brace expansion as known from sh/bash.
          Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/braces"><code>braces</code></a> is a Bash-like brace expansion, implemented in JavaScript.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. It used a regular expression (<code>^\{(,+(?:(\{,+\})*),*|,*(?:(\{,+\})*),+)\}</code>) in order to detects empty braces. This can cause an impact of about 10 seconds matching time for data 50K characters long.</p>

          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>

          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug"><code>debug</code></a> is a JavaScript debugging utility modelled after Node.js core&#39;s debugging technique..</p>
          <p><code>debug</code> uses <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string">printf-style</a> formatting. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks via the the <code>%o</code> formatter (Pretty-print an Object all on a single line). It used a regular expression (<code>/\s*\n\s*/g</code>) in order to strip whitespaces and replace newlines with spaces, in order to join the data into a single line. This can cause a very low impact of about 2 seconds matching time for data 50k characters long.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td>ACCCX</td>
          <td align="right">3</td>
          <td align="right">38</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">4</td>
          <td align="right">71</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">5</td>
          <td align="right">136</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">14</td>
          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dustjs-linkedin">dustjs-linkedin</a> is a Javascript templating engine designed to run asynchronously on both the server and the browser.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Code Injection.
          Dust.js uses Javascript&#39;s <code>eval()</code> function to evaluate the &quot;if&quot; statement conditions. The input to the function is sanitized by escaping all potentially dangerous characters.</p>
          <p>However, if the variable passed in is an array, no escaping is applied, exposing an easy path to code injection. The risk of exploit is especially high given the fact <code>express</code>, <code>koa</code> and many other Node.js servers allow users to force a query parameter to be an array using the <code>param[]=value</code> notation.</p>
          <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>

          <p><code>ejs</code> provides a few different options for you to render a template, two being very similar: <code>ejs.render()</code> and <code>ejs.renderFile()</code>. The only difference being that <code>render</code> expects a string to be used for the template and <code>renderFile</code> expects a path to a template file.</p>
          <p>Both functions can be invoked in two ways. The first is calling them with <code>template</code>, <code>data</code>, and <code>options</code>:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">ejs.render(str, data, options);
          
          ejs.renderFile(filename, data, options, callback)</code></pre>
          <p>The second way would be by calling only the <code>template</code> and <code>data</code>, while <code>ejs</code> lets the <code>options</code> be passed as part of the <code>data</code>:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">ejs.render(str, dataAndOptions);
          
          ejs.renderFile(filename, dataAndOptions, callback)</code></pre>
          <p>If used with a variable list supplied by the user (e.g. by reading it from the URI with <code>qs</code> or equivalent), an attacker can control <code>ejs</code> options. This includes the <code>root</code> option, which allows changing the project root for includes with an absolute path.  </p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">ejs.renderFile(&#39;my-template&#39;, {root:&#39;/bad/root/&#39;}, callback);</code></pre>
          <p>By passing along the root directive in the line above, any includes would now be pulled from <code>/bad/root</code> instead of the path intended. This allows the attacker to take control of the root directory for included scripts and divert it to a library under his control, thus leading to remote code execution.</p>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fresh"><code>fresh</code></a> is HTTP response freshness testing.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. A Regular Expression (<code>/ *, */</code>) was used for parsing HTTP headers and take about 2 seconds matching time for 50k characters.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td>ACCCX</td>
          <td align="right">3</td>
          <td align="right">38</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">4</td>
          <td align="right">71</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">5</td>
          <td align="right">136</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">14</td>
          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>_proto_</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>
          <p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Property definition by path</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="unsafe-object-recursive-merge">Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>
          <p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>
          <pre><code>merge (target, source)
          
            foreach property of source
          
              if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source
          
                merge(target[property], source[property])
          
              else
          
                target[property] = source[property]</code></pre><br>  
          
          <p>When the source object contains a property named <code>_proto_</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>
          <p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>
          <p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>
          <h3 id="property-definition-by-path">Property definition by path</h3>
          <p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>
          <p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>_proto_.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>
          <h2 id="types-of-attacks">Types of attacks</h2>
          <p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

          <td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br><strong>For example:</strong> <code>eval(someobject.someattr)</code>. In this case, if the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.</td>

          <td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-signature"><code>http-signature</code></a> is a reference implementation of Joyent&#39;s HTTP Signature scheme.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attacks due to time-variable comparison of signatures. </p>
          <p>The library implemented a character to character comparison, similar to the built-in string comparison mechanism, <code>===</code>, and not a time constant string comparison. As a result, the comparison will fail faster when the first characters in the signature are incorrect.
          An attacker can use this difference to perform a timing attack, essentially allowing them to guess the signature one character at a time.</p>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime"><code>mime</code></a> is a comprehensive, compact MIME type module.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). It uses regex the following regex <code>/.*[\.\/\\]/</code> in its lookup, which can cause a slowdown of 2 seconds for 50k characters.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td>ACCCX</td>
          <td align="right">3</td>
          <td align="right">38</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">4</td>
          <td align="right">71</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">5</td>
          <td align="right">136</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">14</td>
          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>
          <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>
          <p>Upgrade <code>mime</code> to versions 1.4.1, 2.0.3 or higher.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch"><code>minimatch</code></a> is a minimalistic matching library used for converting glob expressions into JavaScript RegExp objects.
          Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack.  Many Regular Expression implementations may reach edge cases that causes them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the program to enter these extreme situations by using a specially crafted input and cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>
          <p>An attacker can provide a long value to the <code>minimatch</code> function, which nearly matches the pattern being matched. This will cause the regular expression matching to take a long time, all the while occupying the event loop and preventing it from processing other requests and making the server unavailable (a Denial of Service attack).</p>

          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td>ACCCX</td>
          <td align="right">3</td>
          <td align="right">38</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">4</td>
          <td align="right">71</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">5</td>
          <td align="right">136</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">14</td>
          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms">ms</a> is a tiny milisecond conversion utility.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
          attack when converting a time period string (i.e. <code>&quot;2 days&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;1h&quot;</code>) into a milliseconds integer. A malicious user could pass extremely long strings to <code>ms()</code>, causing the server to take a long time to process, subsequently blocking the event loop for that extended period.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms"><code>ms</code></a> is a tiny millisecond conversion utility.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to an incomplete fix for previously reported vulnerability <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ms:20151024">npm:ms:20151024</a>. The fix limited the length of accepted input string to 10,000 characters, and turned to be insufficient making it possible to block the event loop for 0.3 seconds (on a typical laptop) with a specially crafted string passed to <code>ms()</code> function.</p>
          <p><em>Proof of concept</em></p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">ms = require(&#39;ms&#39;);
          ms(&#39;1&#39;.repeat(9998) + &#39;Q&#39;) // Takes about ~0.3s</code></pre>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Snyk&#39;s patch for this vulnerability limits input length to 100 characters. This new limit was deemed to be a breaking change by the author.
          Based on user feedback, we believe the risk of breakage is <em>very</em> low, while the value to your security is much greater, and therefore opted to still capture this change in a patch for earlier versions as well.  Whenever patching security issues, we always suggest to run tests on your code to validate that nothing has been broken.</p>

          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td>ACCCX</td>
          <td align="right">3</td>
          <td align="right">38</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">4</td>
          <td align="right">71</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">5</td>
          <td align="right">136</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">14</td>
          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/negotiator">negotiator</a> is an HTTP content negotiator for Node.js.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (DoS)
          when parsing <code>Accept-Language</code> http header.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td>ACCCX</td>
          <td align="right">3</td>
          <td align="right">38</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">4</td>
          <td align="right">71</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">5</td>
          <td align="right">136</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">14</td>
          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

          <p>Affected versions of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npmconf">npmconf</a> are vulnerable to Uninitialized Memory Exposure. It allocates and writes to disk uninitialized memory content when a typed number is passed as input.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>The Buffer class on Node.js is a mutable array of binary data, and can be initialized with a string, array or number.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">const buf1 = new Buffer([1,2,3]);
          // creates a buffer containing [01, 02, 03]
          const buf2 = new Buffer(&#39;test&#39;);
          // creates a buffer containing ASCII bytes [74, 65, 73, 74]
          const buf3 = new Buffer(10);
          // creates a buffer of length 10</code></pre>
          <p>The first two variants simply create a binary representation of the value it received. The last one, however, pre-allocates a buffer of the specified size, making it a useful buffer, especially when reading data from a stream.
          When using the number constructor of Buffer, it will allocate the memory, but will not fill it with zeros. Instead, the allocated buffer will hold whatever was in memory at the time. If the buffer is not <code>zeroed</code> by using <code>buf.fill(0)</code>, it may leak sensitive information like keys, source code, and system info.</p>
          <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>
          <p>Upgrade <code>npmconf</code> to version 2.1.3. 
          <strong>Note</strong> <code>npmconf</code> is deprecated and should not be used.

          <p>By default parameters that would overwrite properties on the object prototype are ignored, if you wish to keep the data from those fields either use plainObjects as mentioned above, or set allowPrototypes to true which will allow user input to overwrite those properties. WARNING It is generally a bad idea to enable this option as it can cause problems when attempting to use the properties that have been overwritten. Always be careful with this option.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Overwriting these properties can impact application logic, potentially allowing attackers to work around security controls, modify data, make the application unstable and more.</p>
          <p>In versions of the package affected by this vulnerability, it is possible to circumvent this protection and overwrite prototype properties and functions by prefixing the name of the parameter with <code>[</code> or <code>]</code>. e.g. <code>qs.parse(&quot;]=toString&quot;)</code> will return <code>{toString = true}</code>, as a result, calling <code>toString()</code> on the object will throw an exception.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">qs.parse(&#39;toString=foo&#39;, { allowPrototypes: false })
          // {}
          
          qs.parse(&quot;]=toString&quot;, { allowPrototypes: false })
          // {toString = true} &lt;== prototype overwritten</code></pre>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">request</a> is a simplified http request client.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Memory Exposure.
          A potential remote memory exposure vulnerability exists in <code>request</code>. If a <code>request</code> uses a multipart attachment and the <em>body type</em> option is <code>number</code> with value X, then X bytes of uninitialized memory will be sent in the body of the request.</p>
          <p>Note that while the impact of this vulnerability is high (memory exposure), exploiting it is likely difficult, as the attacker needs to somehow control the body type of the request. One potential exploit scenario is when a request is composed based on JSON input, including the body type, allowing a malicious JSON to trigger the memory leak.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Constructing a <code>Buffer</code> class with integer <code>N</code> creates a <code>Buffer</code>
          of length <code>N</code> with non zero-ed out memory.
          <strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">var x = new Buffer(100); // uninitialized Buffer of length 100
          // vs
          var x = new Buffer(&#39;100&#39;); // initialized Buffer with value of &#39;100&#39;</code></pre>
          <p>Initializing a multipart body in such manner will cause uninitialized memory to be sent in the body of the request.</p>
          <h4 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h4>
          <pre><code class="language-js">var http = require(&#39;http&#39;)

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/npm/npm">npm</a> is a package manager for javascript.</p>
          <p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).
          The semver module uses regular expressions when parsing a version string. For a carefully crafted input, the time it takes to process these regular expressions is not linear to the length of the input. Since the semver module did not enforce a limit on the version string length, an attacker could provide a long string that would take up a large amount of resources, potentially taking a server down. This issue therefore enables a potential Denial of Service attack. This is a slightly differnt variant of a typical Regular Expression Denial of Service (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS">ReDoS</a>) vulnerability.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>
          <p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren&#39;t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>
          <p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">regex = /A(B|C+)+D/</code></pre>
          <p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>A</code> The string must start with the letter &#39;A&#39;</li>
          <li><code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter &#39;B&#39; or some number of occurrences of the letter &#39;C&#39; (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.</li>
          <li><code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a &#39;D&#39;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>
          <p>It most cases, it doesn&#39;t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&quot;)&#39;
          0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total
          
          $ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&quot;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&quot;)&#39;
          1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total</code></pre>
          <p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>
          <p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>
          <p>Let&#39;s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: &quot;ACCCX&quot;. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C&#39;s:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>CCC</li>
          <li>CC+C</li>
          <li>C+CC</li>
          <li>C+C+C.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn&#39;t match.</p>
          <p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>
          <table>
          <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>String</th>
          <th align="right">Number of C&#39;s</th>
          <th align="right">Number of steps</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody><tr>
          <td>ACCCX</td>
          <td align="right">3</td>
          <td align="right">38</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">4</td>
          <td align="right">71</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">5</td>
          <td align="right">136</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
          <td align="right">14</td>
          <td align="right">65,553</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p>By the time the string includes 14 C&#39;s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>
          <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>
          <p>Update to a version 4.3.2 or greater. From the issue description [2]: &quot;Package version can no longer be more than 256 characters long. This prevents a situation in which parsing the version number can use exponentially more time and memory to parse, leading to a potential denial of service.&quot;</p>

              <!-- Overview -->
              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p>Versions prior to 0.2.5 did not properly prevent path traversal. Literal dots in a path were resolved out, but url encoded dots were not. Thus, a request like <code>/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd</code> would leak sensitive files and data from the server.</p>
          <p>As of version 0.2.5, any <code>&#39;/../&#39;</code> in the request path, urlencoded or not, will be replaced with <code>&#39;/&#39;</code>. If your application depends on url traversal, then you are encouraged to please refactor so that you do not depend on having <code>..</code> in url paths, as this tends to expose data that you may be surprised to be exposing.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with &quot;dot-dot-slash (../)&quot; sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.</p>
          <p>Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Information Disclosure</strong>: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><code>st</code> is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206">vulnerability of this type</a>. In our example, we will serve files from the <code>public</code> route.</p>
          <p>If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.</p>
          <pre><code>curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa</code></pre><p><strong>Note</strong> <code>%2e</code> is the URL encoded version of <code>.</code> (dot).</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Writing arbitrary files</strong>: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as <code>Zip-Slip</code>. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>One way to achieve this is by using a malicious <code>zip</code> archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.</p>
          <p>The following is an example of a <code>zip</code> archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in <code>/root/.ssh/</code> overwriting the <code>authorized_keys</code> file:</p>
          <pre><code>2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
          2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></pre><h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>

              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tunnel-agent"><code>tunnel-agent</code></a> is HTTP proxy tunneling agent. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Uninitialized Memory Exposure. </p>
          <p>A possible memory disclosure vulnerability exists when a value of type <code>number</code> is used to set the <em>proxy.auth</em> option of a request <code>request</code> and results in a possible uninitialized memory exposures in the request body.</p>
          <p>This is a result of unobstructed use of the <code>Buffer</code> constructor, whose <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/exploiting-buffer/">insecure default constructor increases the odds of memory leakage</a>.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <p>Constructing a <code>Buffer</code> class with integer <code>N</code> creates a <code>Buffer</code> of length <code>N</code> with raw (not &quot;zero-ed&quot;) memory.</p>
          <p>In the following example, the first call would allocate 100 bytes of memory, while the second example will allocate the memory needed for the string &quot;100&quot;:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-js">// uninitialized Buffer of length 100
          x = new Buffer(100);
          // initialized Buffer with value of &#39;100&#39;
          x = new Buffer(&#39;100&#39;);</code></pre>
          <p><code>tunnel-agent</code>&#39;s <code>request</code> construction uses the default <code>Buffer</code> constructor as-is, making it easy to append uninitialized memory to an existing list. If the value of the buffer list is exposed to users, it may expose raw server side memory, potentially holding secrets, private data and code. This is a similar vulnerability to the infamous <a href="http://heartbleed.com/"><code>Heartbleed</code></a> flaw in OpenSSL.</p>
